Notes on the logs
=================

"data/" holds textual logs and C code translations.
There are some log groups, according to variations in parameters:

"cfNNN" holds "speed" color scans with approx. 0x0-2x3 inch^2 at resolution
NNN.

The logs named "NxNxNxN" are 300 dpi "quality" scans used to identify the
window parameters, the "NNNxNxN" are variations like above, but with
"quality" scanning, where the scanner seems to be driven at high
resolutions.

Other logs are occasionally requested and mostly obsolete. Perhaps they are
of any statistical use.
