Some scans order the color stripe RGB, some BRG.
150 DPI and overview (like 160) makes BRG
300 DPI and 600 DPI give RGB.

Not all resolutions are used by the SW5, only 150, 300, 600 DPI.

Preview scanning is faster, but with aspect ratio != 1:1.

Halftone scan seems to provide for bitmap, further investigation needed.
