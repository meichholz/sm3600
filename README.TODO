Things to do for the sm3600 backend

1. Design issues

Reduce the amount of "magic", ie writing of data blocks that were
logged from scanwizard without knowing entirely what they do.
Eventually the driver should be able to compose all of the data for
itself. 

2. Implementation issues
31 May 2001 sm3600-homerun.c DoCalibration()
make it use heap instead of stack memory for the scan lines buffer
