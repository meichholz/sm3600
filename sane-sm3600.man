.SH NAME
sane-sm3600 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners with M011 USB chip
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sane-sm3600
library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that
provides access to some Microtek scanners with the Toshiba M011 custom
USB chip.  This backend should be considered alpha.
.PP 
There exist a backends for Microtek scanners with SCSI command set.
Refer to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5) for details.
.PP
At present, the following
scanners are known positively to work with this backend:

.RE
.PP
If you own a Microtek scanner with the M011 chip other than the ones
listed above, it may or may not work with SANE!

.SH "FRONTEND OPTIONS"
This backend dynamically enables the options for the frontend,
that are supported by the scanner in dependence of the scanning-mode
and other options. Not supported options are disabled.
.PP
The following options are supported by the Microtek2-driver:
.PP
Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.
.PP
contrast, brightness, control, gamma correction.

.SH "DEVICE NAMES"
This backend does not support device names in a usable form.

.SH CONFIGURATION
This backend does not support a configuration file right now.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @LIBDIR@/libsane-sm3600.a
The static library implementing this backend.
.TP
.I @LIBDIR@/libsane-sm3600.so
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SANE_DEBUG_SM3600
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
levels reduce verbosity. To see error messages on stderr set
SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 to 1.

.br
E.g. just say:
.br
export SANE_DEBUG_SM3600=5
