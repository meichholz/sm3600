I made it return, but I don't really know which commands did it
;-).

Here is the command sequence. These are copied from the last log I
sent to you. The last few commands are the ones that did it. If
you comment them out the slider will forward for a couple of
inches. I haven't had time to figure out what is what yet, but
this is a some progress at least.

Register 52 seems to contain some sort of slider position feedback
and it seems to increase as the slider moves home.

Maybe register 43 is the slider speed, 03 = slow, 07 = fast, not
really sure though.

I think register 47 has something to do with movinf the slider
too.
